## Vanilla Bundle 
#### @slickgrid-universal/vanilla-bundle

Vanilla Bundle implementation (no framework, plain TypeSript). This does what other framework would do, it makes all the features usable in 1 bundle to be used by other Apps/Projects, for example we use this bundle in our SalesForce (with Lighning Web Component) App and it requires plain ES6 JavaScript which this bundle also produce (for that there's a `dist-grid-bundle-zip` folder which zip the ES6 `dist` folder which we import in SalesForce). 

### Installation
This Vanilla Bundle is used by the standalone `vanilla-bundle-examples`. 
Go to the root of the repo and follow the instruction provided in the main [README](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal#installation)
