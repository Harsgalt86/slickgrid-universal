 * When value is filled, or if the value is a number and is bigger than 0, it will display a Material Design check icon (mdi-check).
 * The icon will NOT be displayed when the value is any of the following ("false", false, "0", 0, -0.5, null, undefined)
 * Anything else than the condition specified will display the icon, so a text with "00123" will display the icon but "0" will not.
 * Also note that a string ("null", "undefined") will display the icon but (null, undefined) will not, so the typeof is also important
